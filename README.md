## Motivations
 - To provide a platform for people with fine motor control issues to be able to use a computer.
 - It should be capable of supporting quick movements that may have "double input" as is common with cerebral palsy
 - It should be flexible enough in implementation to support a variety of disabilities
     - Parkinsons
     - Cerebral Palsy
     - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
     - RSI
 - Usecases for abled people as well either through a temporary injury, or in a unique context such as in VR environments
 - It should be affordable for all, while the components i've chosen are durable and high quality it should support affordable or home made components with the same layout.
